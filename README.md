# ILP-PizzaDronz
The PizzaDronz is a pizza delivery system which navigates around the University of Edinburgh campus areas and delivers pizzas. The development of the system is funded by the School of Informatics and is intended to serve as a convenient meal option for informatics students. Users will place orders on an application from restaurants participating in the project. After an order has been processed, it will be forwarded to the respective restaurants and the system will start planning a flight path for the drone. Once the calculations are complete and the order is ready for collection, a drone will be launched from the top of Appleton Tower for delivering the order. Once the drone has the pizzas, it will return to Appleton Tower to drop the pizzas off. Various constraints have been placed on the drone to ensure the safety and privacy of students and the public. Most importantly, the business objective of PizzaDronz is to maximize the number of orders delivered each day.
